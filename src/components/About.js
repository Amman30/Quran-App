        <h1>About us</h1>
        The Arabic Quran is considered by Muslims to be verbatim word of God. It has been made
        accessible to non-Arabic speakers through translations. Since English has turned up to be
        the dominant academic and communication language in the current times, we at department of
        Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University of Science and Technology, Kashmir
        intend to make available a large number of English translations of the Quran to people the
        world over. We also intend to focus on local languages of Jammu & Kashmir and bring
        translations in these languages to the fore.
