            AI Dungeon is a text adventure game but unlike traditional text adventure games, which use pre-written content,[1] AI Dungeon uses artificial intelligence to generate open-ended storylines.[2][3][4]

When first beginning the game, players are greeted by the following opening:

"You're about to enter a world of endless possibilities, where you can do absolutely anything you can imagine.... Will you proceed?"[5]

Players are then prompted to choose a setting for their adventure (e.g. fantasy, mystery, apocalyptic, cyberpunk, zombies),[6][7] followed by other options relevant to the setting (such as character class for fantasy settings).[8]

After beginning an adventure, there are three main interaction methods that can be chosen for each of the player's pieces of text input:[9]

Do: Must be followed by a verb, allowing the player to perform an action.
Say: Must be followed by dialog sentences, allowing players to communicate with other characters.
Story: Can be followed by sentences describing something that happens to progress the story, or that players want the AI to know for future events.
The game's artificial intelligence allows it to adapt and respond to almost any action entered by the player.[10]

Providing blank input can also be used to prompt the AI to generate further content, and the game also provides players with options to undo/redo or modify recent events, in order to improve the game's narrative.[11] Players are also given an option to explicitly tell the AI what elements to "remember" for reference in future parts of their playthrough.[12]

User-generated content

AI dungeon with a custom prompt
In addition to the pre-configured settings available in AI Dungeon, players have the ability to create entirely custom "adventures" from scratch, simply by describing the setting in text format. The AI will then generate a setting, based on the user's input.[9][6]

Custom adventures that players create could also be published for others to play through in their own way. The game provided an interface for browsing published adventures, along with the ability to leave comments and upvote/like each one.

Multiplayer
AI Dungeon features a multiplayer mode, whereby different players each have a dedicated character, and can take turns interacting with the AI within the same game session. This supports both online play across multiple devices or local "pass-n-play" style using a shared device.[13][14]

Unlike the single-player game, in which actions and stories use second person narration ("you..."), multiplayer game stories are presented using third-person narration.[14]

Each game's host player is given additional permissions (likened to that of a Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master) whereby they can supervise the AI and make modifications to its output.[13][14]

Worlds
AI Dungeon also provides players with the ability to set their adventures within specific 'Worlds', which give context to the broader environment in which the adventure takes place.[15] This feature was first released with two different worlds available for selection:
